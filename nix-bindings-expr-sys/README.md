# nix-bindings-expr-sys

This crate contains generated bindings for the Nix C API (`nix-expr-c`).
**You should not have to use this crate directly,** and so you should probably not add it to your dependencies.
Instead, use the `nix-bindings-expr` crate, which _should_ be sufficient.

## Changelog

See the [nix-bindings-rust changelog](https://github.com/nixops4/nix-bindings-rust/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
